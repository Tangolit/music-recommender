# music-recommender
This was an introductory project into Machine Learning, in which I took a csv file with sample data containing the ages, genders, and favorite genre of music listened to for 40 people. I then cleaned up the file, and wrote a program using a Decision Tree to predict a person's favorite genre given their age and gender upon the user's input.
