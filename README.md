# music-recommender
This was an introductory project into Machine Learning, in which I took a csv file with sample data containing the Ages, Genders, and favorite genres of music listened to for 40 people. I then cleaned up the file, and wrote a program using a Decision Tree to predict a person's favorite genre given their Age and Gender upon the user's input.
